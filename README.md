A Chinese automobile company "Geely Auto" aspires to enter the US market by setting up their manufacturing unit there and producing cars locally to give competition to their US and European counterparts. They have contracted an automobile consulting company to understand the factors on which the pricing of cars depends.
Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the pricing of cars in the American market, since those may be very different from the Chinese market. The company wants to know:

* Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a car
* How well those variables describe the price of a car

Based on various market surveys, the consulting firm has gathered a large dataset of different types of cars across the America market. We are required to model the price of cars with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables.
They can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

### Approach
Inquiry made into understanding the data and its values showed that the data contained considerable amount of continuous data values. Thus requiring the use of Regression statistical model for analysis.
Further inquiry made into the dataset showed Price to be the dependent variable. Employing the use of visualization tools such as Scatterplots, Pairplots and Lasso, I was able to find features or independent variables with positive and negative correlations to the dependent variable, **Price**. 
Upon Identification of the independent variable(s), I therefore carried out the needed regression calculations and designed a model that can help in future price predictions.
