A Chinese automobile company "Geely Auto" aspires to enter the US market by setting up their manufacturing unit there and producing cars locally to give competition to their US and European counterparts. They have contracted an automobile consulting company to understand the factors on which the pricing of cars depends.
Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the pricing of cars in the American market, since those may be very different from the Chinese market. The company wants to know:

* Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a car
* How well those variables describe the price of a car

Based on various market surveys, the consulting firm has gathered a large dataset of different types of cars across the America market. We are required to model the price of cars with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables.
They can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

### Approach
Inquiry made into understanding the data and its values showed that the data contained considerable amount of continuous data values. Thus requiring the use of Regression statistical model for analysis.
Further inquiry made into the dataset showed Price to be the dependent variable. Employing the use of visualization tools such as Scatterplots, Pairplots and Lasso, I was able to find features or independent variables with positive and negative correlations to the dependent variable, **Price**. 
Upon Identification of the independent variable(s), I therefore carried out the needed regression calculations and designed a model that can help in future price predictions.

### Methodology
* Dataset Description
* Data Cleaning
* Data Visualization
* Data Preparation
* Standardization
* Univariate Analysis
* Multivariate Analysis
* Conclusion

Network security is a broad term that covers a multitude of technologies, devices and processes. In its simplest term, it is a set of rules and configurations designed to protect the integrity, confidentiality and accessibility of computer networks and data using both software and hardware technologies. Every organization, regardless of size, industry or infrastructure, requires a degree of network security solutions in place to protect it from the ever-growing landscape of cyber threats in the wild today.
Today's network architecture is complex and is faced with a threat environment that is always changing and attackers that are always trying to find and exploit vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities can exist in a broad number of areas, including devices, data, applications, users and locations. For this reason, there are many network security management tools and applications in use today that address individual threats and exploits and also regulatory non-compliance. When just a few minutes of downtime can cause widespread disruption and massive damage to an organization's bottom line and reputation, it is essential that these protection measures are in place.
For the network security repository, i created a python script named [wifi.py](https://github.com/Josiah-Jovido/Projects/blob/main/Network_security/wifi.py) that when run on a windows computer command line will display all the wifi passwords on that system. Its a short script with a few lines of python code but powerful enough to extract all the wifi usernames and passwords in a window's computer. Of course we know the implications of this if not properly used. This project is strictly for educational purposes to show the importance of having a good network security in any company/organization.
